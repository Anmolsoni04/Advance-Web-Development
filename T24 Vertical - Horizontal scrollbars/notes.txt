If any content is overflowing to a box, then to overcome this overflowing we use overflow property.

There are several Ways to fix the overflow:

We can use overflow-property
i.e.,

overflow: scroll;
(Scroll bar will display either the content is fixed or not)

overflow: auto;
(Scroll bar display only when the content is not fixed, if the content is fixed then scroll bar will not display)

white-space: nowrap;
(It will show whole content in horizontal form, not vertical form)

text-overflow: ellipses;
(It will show ... after content) in any condition

(Suggestion: use overflow: auto; Mostly!)

overflow-x: hidden;
overflow-y: hidden;

-> will hide vertical & horizontal content

or

overflow-x: scroll;
overflow-y: hidden;

-> will display horizontal content and hide vertical content

or

overflow-x: hidden;
overflow-y: scroll;

-> will display vertical content and hide horizontal content

or we can write this in a one line in a 
following Way:

(overflow: x y;) //syntax

overflow: scroll hidden
-> scroll at x and hidden at y

or

overflow: hidden scroll
-> hidden at x and scroll at y.
