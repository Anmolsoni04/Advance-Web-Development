EcmaScript:
It's an standard on which Js is based! It ensure that different doc's on js are actually talking about the same language!

var VS let:

var is globally scoped.
let and const are block scoped.


var can be updated & Re-Declared within it's scope.
let can be updated but not declared.

const can neither be updated nor re-declared

That's why you always have to use 'let' in modern javascript!
