Collection of multiple data types called Arrays in Js.

like-> Strings, numbers, objects, etc.

Array Methods:
1) String Method -> It will return the numbers in arrays into strings.
2) Join Method -> It will join the symbols, numbers, strings into an array like (-_, &,, and ) etc.... 
3) Pop Method -> It will remove the element from the last in array.
4) Push Method -> It will add the element in array from last and also return the length of the strings.
5) Shift Method -> Works like Pop method & it's vice-versa.
6) UnShift Method -> Works like push method & it's vice versa.
7) Delete Method -> Will delete the number from array but length will remain same.
8) Concat Method -> Will merge multiple arrays and make an single array.
9) Splice Method ->  
Let's an array:
arr = [1,5,3,2,4]
if we do splice :
splice(2,3) then these numbers will remove:
[3,2,4]
and this is the generated array:
[1,5]
If we do this 
console.log(1,5,4,100,200,300)
then (100,200,300) will add in the Array
[1,5,4,100,200,300]
10) Slice Method -> it will slice out the piece from an array and will create a new array.
