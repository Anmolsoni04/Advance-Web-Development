Syntax of shadowing:
box-shaddow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;

h-offset & v-offset -> Determines the position of shadow either it's vertical or horizontal

blur: large the value, more will be the blurred shadow
spread: expands Or shrinks the shadow size!
color: defines the color of shadow
inset: Makes the shaddow inner


Syntax of text shadow is exactly same as the box shadow


Outline's Syntax

outline: width style color;


Basic Differences between outline and border:


1) postion-> outline dont take up space, they r drawn around the element but border don'take.

2) Offset-> using the outline-offset property, we can set the space bw an outline and the border of an element, but this change can't possible in border

3) width-> outlines have uniform width but border have a varying width

4) rounded corners-> Outlines cannot have rounded corners  but using border-radius we can adjust the corners of border.
