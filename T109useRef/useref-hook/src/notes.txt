const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  let a = 0;
  useEffect(() => {
    a  = a + 1;
    console.log(`Rerendering happenssss and the value of a is ${a}`)
  })

  by doing this we face a problem that on every render the value of a is not changing that's why we use useRef() hook here, to stop this problem,

  so we can use useRef() hook in this way:


  ////////// code ////////////

  import {useRef} from 'react';

  const a = useRef();
  useEffect (() => {
    a.current = a.current + 1
    console.log(`the value of a on every rendering is ${a.current}`)
  })
