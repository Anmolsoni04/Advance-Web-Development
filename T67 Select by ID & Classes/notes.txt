DOM TREE->
It refers to the HTML page where all the nodes are objects.
There are 3types of nodes:

a) Text Nodes
b) Element Nodes
c) Comment Nodes

in html, <html> -> ROOT
<head>, <body> -> children

*Text Node-> Leaf of the tree.

CHIDREN OF AN ELEMENT:
Direct as well as deeply nested elements of an element are called its children.

child nodes -> are those nodes in which elements are the direct children. example> head,body are the direct children of html.

element.firstChild -> first child element
element.lastChild -> second child element
element.childNodes -> All child nodes

*ChildNodes always looks like an array but it's not array, actually an array but collection. We can use array from collection to convert it into an array.


DOM COLLECTIONS:
->They are read-only.
-> They are live. element.childNodes variable(reference) will automatically update if child nodes of element is changed.
-> They are iterable using for of loop.

6) document.getElementsByName
-> Search the elements by the name attribute.

7) Matches closest and contains methods
